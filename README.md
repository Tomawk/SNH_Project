# Fastpizza Website

 Fastpizza is a website developed using HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP. It was a project made for the exam of web developing during my Bachelor Degree. 
 
 ## Application
 
 Fastpizza is a website of a pizzeria, a customer can:
 
 * Make a reservation at the physical restaurant
 * Order a pizza online, creating its own pizza with the ingredients that wishes
 * Remove or add pizzas to his/her cart
 * Check his/her past orders

In order to do so, the registration is mandatory. Otherwise the website can be used to contact the restaurant and reading all the information about it.
Ordering a pizza with this website is fun, the customer can create its own pizza with a tool created with Javascript.

## Repository

The project repository is organized as follows:

* *CSS* This folder contains all the CSS file for the graphical part of the website
* *Creation* This is a folder with all the vectorial images used in the creation of the pizza (Javascript tool)
* *immagini* (Images in english) It is a folder that contains all the images used in the website
* *utility* It contains some utility scripts made in PHP
* *.php Files* These files are the pages of the website. The index page is the main page of the website and the first that will be displayed
